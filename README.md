# PlatformIO + IMST WiMODino

## Description

This is a small test firmware that demonstrates building a basic firmware for the IMST WiMODino board.

It uses a forked platform-atmelsam (board definition + package selection) with [maxgerhardt/framework-wimodino](https://github.com/maxgerhardt/framework-wimodino) as the framework code, identical to what is used in https://wireless-solutions.de/downloads/boards-manager/WiMODino/package_imst_de_index.json
